How It's Made:

Tech used: 
Front End HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Lessons Learned:

This application has been a continuous journey of utlizing client side and server side javascript to build a fullstack application. I was impressed with how simple express and other npm modules made it easier to curate a server. Lastly, using CRUD has shown me how all applications we use utlitize these four principles.
